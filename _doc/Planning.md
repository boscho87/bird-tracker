# Idea

- Capture Sequences, when movement is detected
- Check if the Species is already in the Database
- Store the Sequence in the Database
- Store the Sequence if the image is not recognized to learn new Species
  - Let the User help to Learn the Species VIA WebUI
- Notify the User if a new Sequence is captured
- Show the Sequences in the WebUI
